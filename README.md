24SEP 02:21AM - Horrible experience working with positioning and the carousel. It's a curse, according to stack overflow and countless hours researching - there is no way to make it work with the current implementation.

25SEP 17:25 - This is really fun, I fixed all previous problems and just steamrolled ahead. Doing the workit-kit (to-do list for work) before this project has drilled some good concepts into me. I loved working on every bit of the project here.

25SEP 20:00 - Final commit (probably). The modals got the least love because I was too excited to deploy. This project was fun and it did work my brain a lot - I had ups and downs: notably the carousel implementation, and analysis paralysis on the menu, plus for some reason - the git ERROR CANNOT PARSE HEAD issue, with the 100mb issue that had caused me to loose a couple of days. 

If there is any advice I'd give my old self starting this project - it would be to use lower mb media, and to give more time for myself to rest. Otherwise, I am very happy with the end-result.

The biggest hindarance has only been tackling CSS in the carousel, everything else has been a breeze - especially due to SOLID principles and good modularization of code.
