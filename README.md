25SEP 17:25 - This is really fun, I fixed all previous problems and just steamrolled ahead. Doing the workit-kit (to-do list for work) before this project has drilled some good concepts into me. I loved working on every bit of the project here.

The biggest hindarance has only been tackling CSS in the carousel, everything else has been a breeze - especially due to SOLID principles and good modularization of code.
